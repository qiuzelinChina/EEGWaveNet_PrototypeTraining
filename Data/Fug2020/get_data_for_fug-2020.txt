1. Download the original data [1] into this fold. The downloaded files in this fold should contains: ds-eeg-snhl.tar
2. Unzip ds-eeg-snhl.tar to this fold
3. Run preprocess_data_raw.m and you will obtain a folder named "preprocessed", which contains the extracted EEG and corresponding label (./preprocessed/S*_raw.mat).
4. Run add_wavelet.m to conduct filtering, re-reference and wavelet transform. The output file named "S*_preprocessed.mat" are stored in the preprocessed folder (./preprocessed/S*_preprocessed.mat).
5. Run get_data_python.py to convert data format. The output file named "S*_preprocessed_py.mat" are stored in the preprocessed folder (./preprocessed/S*_preprocessed_py.mat).

Note: 
1. We only consider subjects with normal hearing (21-40, 43, 44), and subject 24 is excluded due to a break in the experiment.
2. The preprocess_data_raw.m is modified from /src/examples/examplescript2.m in https://gitlab.com/sfugl/snhl.
