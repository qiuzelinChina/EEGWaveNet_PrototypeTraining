1. Download the original data [1] into this fold. The downloaded files in this fold should contains: S*.mat, stimuli.zip
2. Unzip stimuli.zip 
3. Run preprocess_data_raw.mat and you will obtain a folder named "preprocessed", which contains the extracted EEG and corresponding label (./preprocessed/S*_raw.mat).
4. Run add_wavelet.m to conduct filtering, re-reference and wavelet transform. The output file named "S*_preprocessed.mat" are stored in the preprocessed folder (./preprocessed/S*_preprocessed.mat).
5. Run get_data_python.py to convert data format. The output file named "S*_preprocessed_py.mat" are stored in the preprocessed folder (./preprocessed/S*_preprocessed_py.mat).
